# Image Classifiers
This is a beginner friendly repo for those who want to use DL techniques in Computer Vision, which uses Tensorflow 2.0 framework for implementing deep learning models, with handy datasets.</br>

## Getting Started

You just need google account for the whole process.Just open the notebooks using [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) an awesome initiative from **GOOGLE**.

### Prerequisites

Only thing required is you should know python, rest other things will be handled with the self explanatory notebook.</br> Knowing **Tensorflow** could help a lot to understand notebooks quickly.

## What's in there?

There are Various Classifier notebooks for different use-cases.</br>
- [Cats-vs-Dogs](https://github.com/kb10241024/CLASSIFIER_MODELS/tree/master/Cats-Vs-Dogs) (Most basic one for getting started used widely)
- [Horse-vs-Human](https://github.com/kb10241024/CLASSIFIER_MODELS/tree/master/Horse-or-Human) (Trained on animated images from tensorflow, but works quite good for real time dataset too).
- [Happy-or-Sad](https://github.com/kb10241024/CLASSIFIER_MODELS/tree/master/Happy-or-sad) (Classifier for different imogis trained on a dataset of few hundred images)
- [Fashion-MNIST and MNIST-Digit-Recognition](https://github.com/kb10241024/CLASSIFIER_MODELS/tree/master/000Multiclass_Classification/MNIST-and-Fashion_MNIST)
- [Rock-Paper-Scissor](https://github.com/kb10241024/CLASSIFIER_MODELS/tree/master/000Multiclass_Classification/Rock-Paper-Scissor)(Fun example for recognising hand gesture in rock-paper-scissor game).
